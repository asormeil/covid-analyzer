# COVID Data Visualization App

This is a comprehensive COVID data visualization app built with React and Redux. It provides users with three main pages:

## Worldmap Page

The Charts page presents various charts and graphs showcasing COVID-related data for a specific country. Users can select a country from the dropdown menu to view the data visualization.


## Installation

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the development server using `npm start`.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can access it by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Worldmap Page


The Worldmap page displays an interactive world map with markers for each country. Each marker represents the country's COVID-19 statistics, such as the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. Users can click on a marker to view detailed information about that specific country. The map also supports zooming and panning for better navigation.

## Comparatives Page


The Comparatives page allows users to select multiple countries and compare their COVID-19 data side by side. Users can choose specific statistics to compare, such as confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and more. The data is displayed in tabular format for easy comparison.

## Charts Page


The Charts page offers various charts and graphs to visualize COVID-19 mortality data. Users can select a country and view the corresponding mortality data represented in line charts. The charts display information about deaths in different years, including 2023, average deaths from 2015 to 2019, deaths since 2020, and deaths in 2015.
